# Simple Diffusion

This repository is a small compilation of Diffusion Model tutorials and examples, while focussing more on implementation concerns 
and less on theory or foundations. 

**Note**: This is a work in progress, and will be updated as I learn more about the subject.

# Notebooks

- [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)]() - A simple implementation of DDPM, with a focus on the training loop and the 
  sampling pipeline.

# Requirements

Most of the notebooks should be compatible with Google Colab. However, if you want to run them locally, you will need the following -

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.13+
- diffusers
- einops
- tqdm
- matplotlib
